<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **Zu Lizheng**, currently a Ph.D. candidate at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), co-supervised by Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. My research focuses on **knowledge graphs, intelligent agents, large language models**, and **time series prediction**. I have published over 10 first-author or corresponding-author papers, including top-tier conferences like CVPR and high-impact SCI journals such as *Expert Systems with Applications*, *Knowledge-Based Systems*, and *IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica*, with a cumulative impact factor exceeding 60.5.

My academic background includes:
- **Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering**, Harbin Institute of Technology (2021.9 ‚Äì Present)
- **Joint Ph.D. in NLP**, Nanyang Technological University (2024.10 ‚Äì Present)
- **M.S. in Mechatronic Engineering**, Yanshan University (2018.9 ‚Äì 2021.7, top 5%)
- **B.Eng. in Mechanical Design and Automation**, Yanshan University (2013.9 ‚Äì 2017.6, top 30%)
- **Exchange Program**, McGill University, Data Science Project (2020.10 ‚Äì 2021.1)
