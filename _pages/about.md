<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Mechatronics Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), and currently a joint Ph.D. student at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.
I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Lin Lin and Prof. Song Fu at HIT, and Prof. Siu Cheung Hui at NTU. I have also closely collaborated with Prof. Pan Zhou.
